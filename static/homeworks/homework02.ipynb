    "### Murder Mystery as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (7 pts.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One could view the clues given in logic puzzles, like a murder mystery, as constraints in a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if the clue were to be \"The Revolver was not in the Kitchen or the Ballroom\" we can turn this into constraints. If the Revolver were to be the murder weapon then the room of the murder could not be the Kitchen or the Ballroom. Conversely, if the murder room was found to be the Kitchen or the Ballroom then the murder weapon could not be the revolver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given below are a series of clues and some starter code, your job as the lead detective in this case is to turn the clues into a series of \"constraint functions\" (the first has been given as a reference implementation) and then write the basic backtracking algorithm to help solve the murder! Good luck detective, we're counting on you.\n",
    "\n",
    "To discover who killed Mr. Boddy, you need to learn where each person was, and what weapon was in the room. Clues are scattered throughout the quiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, you need to know the suspects. There are three men (George, John, Robert) and three women (Barbara, Christine, Yolanda). Each person was in a different room (Bathroom, Dining Room, Kitchen, Living Room, Pantry, Study). A suspected weapon was found in each room (Bag, Firearm, Gas, Knife, Poison, Rope). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The man in the kitchen was not found with the rope, knife, or bag. Which weapon, then, which was not the firearm, was found in the kitchen?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Barbara was either in the study or the bathroom; Yolanda was in the other. Which room was Barbara found in?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The person with the bag, who was not Barbara nor George, was not in the bathroom nor the dining room. Who had the bag in the room with them?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The woman with the rope was found in the study. Who had the rope?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The weapon in the living room was found with either John or George. What weapon was in the living room?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The knife was not in the dining room. So where was the knife?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Yolanda was not with the weapon found in the study nor the pantry. What weapon was found with Yolanda?\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The firearm was in the room with George. In which room was the firearm found?\n",
    "\n",
    "It was discovered that Mr. Boddy was gassed in the pantry. The suspect found in that room was the murderer. Who, then, do you point the finger towards?"

    "\n",
    "\t1.\tKnowledge Representation: Watson encodes medical knowledge in a structured, symbolic form, representing relationships between diseases, symptoms, treatments, and outcomes. For example, it might encode that if a patient has symptom X and test result Y, then disease Z is a possible diagnosis.\n",
    "\t2.\tLogical Inference: Given a set of patient symptoms and test results, Watson uses symbolic reasoning to infer possible diagnoses by applying rules and relationships from its knowledge base. It reasons through chains of implications, much like the emoji example, to determine which diseases are most likely based on the provided data.\n",
    "\t3.\tExplainability: One of the key advantages of using symbolic reasoning in Watson is its ability to provide clear explanations for its recommendations. It can trace the logical steps it took to arrive at a particular diagnosis or treatment, which is crucial for gaining the trust of medical professionals."
